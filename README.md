# OptimisationMethods-IIITH-

This is done as part of Optimisation Methods course at IIIT-Hyderabad

## Linear Programming
Here, there are a few classical problems solved using Linear Programming. Formulations for different problems are given and are solved using optimisation techniques. Find them at [Linear Programming - Notebook](../master/Linear%20Programming/LinearProgramming.ipynb)

## Manifold Learning
Here, we use the concepts of Manifold Learning and Spectral Clustering to predict clusters and visualize data. Find them at [Manifold Learning - Notebook](../master/Manifold%20Learning/Manifold%20Learning.ipynb)
